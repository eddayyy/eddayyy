## Projects

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI 

This project was developed using only C++, there are 2 versions of this game. 
Version 1: Traditional 2 Player Tic-Tac-Toe that any 2 humans can play
Version 2: Single player Tic-Tac-Toe where the human plays against an AI. This AI runs off of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm and plays to prevent the user from winning. 

### Portfolio Website

Developed a personal website by self-learning HTML and CSS. This website was deployed using GitHub Pages. It contains my resume, profile picture, and a list of courses I have taken.
